# OKChain Testnets

This repo collects the genesis and configuration files for the various OKChain
testnets. It exists so the [OKChain repo](https://github.com/okex/okchain)
does not get bogged down with large genesis files and status updates.

## Getting Started

To get started with the latest testnet, see the
